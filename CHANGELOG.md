# Changelog

## [2.0.0] - 2026-02-27

### Added
- **Raw DOM Queries** check (#7, Tier 1): Detects `document.querySelector*` / `getElementById` inside `evaluate()` / `waitForFunction()` that bypass framework element APIs
- **Hard-coded Timeouts** check (#12, Tier 2): Detects `waitForTimeout()` / `cy.wait(ms)` and magic timeout numbers without explanation
- **POM error swallowing** detection in #3: `.catch(() => {})` / `.catch(() => false)` on POM wait/assertion methods
- **POM boolean trap** detection in #5: Methods returning `Promise<boolean>` instead of exposing element handles
- **Cross-file duplicate** detection in #9: Cross-check similar test names across different spec files
- **Severity guide** in output format: HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW classification for findings
- **Quick Reference** table restored (14 items, compressed)
- **Skip protection** rule: `test.skip()` with a reason comment or string is intentional — do not flag

### Changed
- **Framework-agnostic**: Principles are now framework-independent with specific guidance for Playwright, Cypress, and Puppeteer where they differ (#5, #7, #12)
- **POM files in scope**: Review checklist now explicitly covers Page Object Model files, not just spec files
- Renumbered all checks (1-7 Tier 1, 8-14 Tier 2) to accommodate new items
- Updated README pattern tables to 14 items with framework-agnostic examples
- Updated plugin.json and marketplace.json descriptions and keywords

### Removed
- Playwright-only assumptions from rules and examples

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Tier structure**: Checks split into Tier 1 (high-impact bugs, always check) and Tier 2 (quality improvements, check when time permits)
- **Flaky Selectors** check (#11): Detects positional selectors (`nth()`, `first()`) and unstable raw text matching that break across environments or i18n changes

### Changed
- Merged "Conditional Assertions" and "Conditional Skip" into a single **Conditional Bypass** check (#6) — both are symptoms of the same root cause
- Trimmed examples for obvious patterns (Always-Passing, Boolean Trap) — kept only BAD examples where the anti-pattern is self-evident
- Renumbered all checks to reflect tier ordering (1-6 Tier 1, 7-12 Tier 2)
- Updated README pattern tables to match new tier structure

### Removed
- Quick Reference table (redundant with detailed check sections)
- Verification section (too generic to be useful)
- "When to Use" section (redundant with frontmatter description)
- ~48% reduction in SKILL.md line count while preserving all detection rules

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-15

### Added
- Initial release with 12-point checklist
- Detects: name-assertion mismatch, missing Then, render-only tests, duplicate scenarios, misleading names, over-broad assertions, always-passing assertions, conditional assertions, error swallowing, boolean traps, conditional skips, YAGNI in Page Objects
- Framework-agnostic design with Playwright examples
- YAGNI audit procedure with classification table output
- Task-based output format with concrete code fixes
